<h2>Who is Tim?</h2>
<p>Hi! my name is Kim Timur Vladimirovich<br>
I'm 29 years old, I'm an engineer. For 7 years I have been designing control and automation of marine oil and gas drilling platforms. Just like in the movie Deepwater Horizon. I bought a car, moved out from my parents, but time passed and I wanted to move on. Therefore, in 2024, I decided to change my job to something that has always fascinated me - programming. I start my journey with Ruby</p>
